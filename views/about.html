<h1>About</h1>
	<p>OpenPath enables place-based learning. It uses location-based videochat sessions to connect learners to events at museums, libraries, parks, makerspaces, and more. </p>
	<h2>FAQ</h2>
	<p><strong>Is it free to use?</strong></p>
	<p>Yes. OpenPath is free to use.</p>
	<strong>How do I sign up?</strong>
	<p>Just login using <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/persona/">Persona</a>. Persona is a Web identity system designed by Mozilla. It allows you to sign in to Web sites with an email you choose without all the profile information associated with other login authentication services. You can add your profile information later on OpenPath for a more personalized experience.</p>
	<strong>What browser do I need?</strong>
	<p>The Google Chrome browser has all of the technology you need built-in. The Chrome browser is available for free <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/">here</a> and is available for Windows, Mac and Linux. Firefox is not far behind and we plan to support that browser as well. For users of Internet Explorer, use the <a href="http://www.google.com/chromeframe">Chrome Frame</a>.  The technology is still maturing, so we expect most browsers will eventually support WebRTC fully.</p>
	<p><strong>Does this work on mobile phones?</strong></p>
	<p>If you have an Android-based phone, download the latest Chrome browser. The newest browsers allow WebRTC to work. If you have an iOS device, stay tuned. The WebRTC folks are working with the Webkit folks, but it is unclear when it will be available. </p>
	<p><strong>How does this work?</strong></p>
	<p>We are using a combination of HTML5, Javascript, and WebRTC. WebRTC stands for Web &ldquo;Real-Time Communication.&rdquo; The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium">World Wide Web Consortium</a> (W3C) is drafting an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface">API</a> definition to enable <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser">browser</a>-based <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_calling">voice calling</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_chat">video chat</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P2P_file_sharing">P2P file sharing</a> without <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plugins">plugins</a>. The WebRTC initiative is a project supported by Google, Mozilla, and Opera. </p>
	<p><strong>What is a path?</strong></p>
	<p>We all have our own interest-driven learning journey to take. Over time, your individual path is the collection of events, places, and experiences in which you&rsquo;ve participated. </p>
	<p>On OpenPath, in addition to your profile, you can create events and paths. Events are things like an online tour you are giving of your favorite neighborhood. These can take place via our location-based video. </p>
	<p>Paths are curated collections of interesting locations and events around a topic. For instance, a walking tour of a city, or a tour of multiple museums that include artwork by a particular artist. In the future, you will be able to upload your own paths that other people can use.</p>
	<p><strong>Can I just use it for videochat?</strong></p>
	<p>Sure you can. You can use it to hang out and share things with others. The emphasis of the site is on learning.</p>
